## Description

My project leverages the power of various technologies to provide an immersive and engaging experience for D&D enthusiasts. The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Three.js and Drei are used to create stunning 3D models and animations, bringing your characters to life. Fiber of Three.js is employed to optimize the performance and rendering capabilities of Three.js.

For the user interface, I utilize DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS, which provide a responsive design and a wide range of pre-built UI components. The website is created using HTML, CSS, and modern web development practices.

On the backend, I have chosen Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime, to handle server-side operations. Socket.io is used for real-time communication between players, allowing seamless collaboration and interaction during gameplay. To store and retrieve game data, I employ MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database.
